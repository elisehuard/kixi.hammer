# hammer

Simple utilities we reuse to parse and slice and dice our data with clojure.

Gathering:

* enable IO from common data formats like CSV (and excel, though docjure takes care of that)
* some utils for cleaning
* operations that occur time and again like join
* some common specs or conformers
